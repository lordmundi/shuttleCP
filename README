Jog Dial for ChiliPeppr


This code is meant to allow button, jog, and shuttle events from
a Contour ShuttleXpress controller to flow to CNC machines
The original branch of this code was developed for communication 
with the Serial Port JSON server typically used with ChiliPeppr 
driven CNC machines.  
The latest version adds communication to CNC machines driven with bCNC.


Interface to Shuttle Contour Xpress based on "Contour ShuttlePro
v2 interface" by Eric Messick.


Configuration instructions:

1. Edit shuttlecp.c and update the following items at the top of the file:

#define CNC_HOST      "localhost"         // Hostname where SPJS or bCNC is running
#define CNC_PORT      "8989"              // Port for SPJS or bCNC.  Typically 8989 for Chillipeppr and 8080 for bCNC
#define DEVICE_PATH   "/dev/ttyACM0"      // Path for SPJS to connect to GRBL or TinyG.  Not used for bCNC
#define TINYG         0                   // set to 1 if you are using a TinyG
#define BCNC          0                   // set to 1 if you are using bCNC instead of Chilipeppr
#define CYCLE_TIME_MICROSECONDS 100000    // time of each main loop iteration
#define MAX_FEED_RATE 1500.0              // (unit per minute - initially tested with millimeters)
#define OVERSHOOT     1.06                // amount of overshoot for shuttle wheel

2. For ChiliPeppr, make sure ChiliPeppr is already connected to the SPJS 
and opened the connection to the board, as this utility sends commands 
assuming that CP has already opened the port at the correct baud rate.

For bCNC, make sure that bCNC is running and connected to the GRBL board.


Build instructions:
(written for Raspbian, but should work for others)

1. Ensure openssl dev libraries are installed:
 sudo apt-get install libssl-dev build-essential libcurl4-openssl-dev

2. Download the nopoll library from here: http://www.aspl.es/nopoll/downloads/
(I'm currently using version 0.2.7.b164 because I got a strange linking error when
I tried to compile 0.2.8.b184 for some odd reason.  Feel free to try both).  
Extract, configure, make, and install the nopoll library with the usual:
 ./configure
 make
 sudo make install


3. Download the cURL library from here: https://curl.haxx.se/download.html
Extract, configure, make, and install the cURL library with the usual:
 ./configure
 make
 sudo make install


4. If you will have leds or switches hooked to a raspberry pi, take a git clone 
of the wiringPi utility and use their included build script to build and install
the library. Instructions are here: http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/

If you aren't using led's and switches, just edit the Makefile and change the 
GPIO_SUPPORT to 0 to disable it.  You can also remove -lwiringPi from the libs
line.


5. Go into the ShuttleCP directory and run "make". Make sure you've edited
any items from the "Configuration" section above first.

 make

I also do the following to install shuttlecp so that it can be run regardless
of which folder you are in when you execute the program.
 sudo make install


Running:

1. For ChiliPeppr, first, make sure SPJS is already running and ChiliPeppr has 
already opened a connection to your machine.  I run SPJS on the same raspberryPi 
that I run the ShuttleCP utility on.

For bCNC, make sure that bCNC is running and is connected to the GRBL board.
All alarms must be clared and the CNC machine state is reported as "Idle".

2. Start up shuttlecp with an argument that is the device interface for your
ShuttleXpress.  Mine is /dev/input/by-id/usb-Contour_Design_ShuttleXpress-event-if00
Use sudo so that wiringPi has access to GPIO pins:

 sudo ./shuttlecp /dev/input/by-id/usb-Contour_Design_ShuttleXpress-event-if00

Or, you can use the "./shuttle" script, which effectively does the same thing.
